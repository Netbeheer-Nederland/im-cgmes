    is_a: ACDCConverter
    description: 'DC side of the current source converter (CSC).

      The firing angle controls the dc voltage at the converter, both for rectifier
      and inverter. The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter
      determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage
      at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing
      angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary
      means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on
      top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective
      it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc)
      and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle,
      transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore
      attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.

      The reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle,
      transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated
      with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and
      dc current.

      The attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier
      operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range
      is typically 10-18 degrees.

      The attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for
      inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place.
      The range is typically 17-20 degrees.'

    description: 'For a detailed substation model a topological node is a set of connectivity
      nodes that, in the current network state, are connected together through any
      type of closed switches, including  jumpers. Topological nodes change as the
      current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state).

      For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to form topological nodes.
      Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. Topological
      nodes maintained this way are also called "busses".'
