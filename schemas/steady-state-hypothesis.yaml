    is_a: PowerSystemResource
    description: 'A control area is a grouping of generating units and/or loads and
      a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a variety of purposes
      including automatic generation control, power flow solution area interchange
      control specification, and input to load forecasting. All generation and load
      within the area defined by the terminals on the border are considered in the
      area interchange control. Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications
      can be superimposed on the physical model. The following general principles
      apply to ControlArea:

      1.  The control area orientation for net interchange is positive for an import,
      negative for an export.

      2.  The control area net interchange is determined by summing flows in Terminals.
      The Terminals are identified by creating a set of TieFlow objects associated
      with a ControlArea object. Each TieFlow object identifies one Terminal.

      3.  In a single network model, a tie between two control areas must be modelled
      in both control area specifications, such that the two representations of the
      tie flow sum to zero.

      4.  The normal orientation of Terminal flow is positive for flow into the conducting
      equipment that owns the Terminal. (i.e. flow from a bus into a device is positive.)
      However, the orientation of each flow in the control area specification must
      align with the control area convention, i.e. import is positive. If the orientation
      of the Terminal flow referenced by a TieFlow is positive into the control area,
      then this is confirmed by setting TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag TRUE. If not,
      the orientation must be reversed by setting the TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag
      FALSE.'

    is_a: ACDCConverter
    description: 'DC side of the current source converter (CSC).

      The firing angle controls the dc voltage at the converter, both for rectifier
      and inverter. The difference between the dc voltages of the rectifier and inverter
      determines the dc current. The extinction angle is used to limit the dc voltage
      at the inverter, if needed, and is not used in active power control. The firing
      angle, transformer tap position and number of connected filters are the primary
      means to control a current source dc line. Higher level controls are built on
      top, e.g. dc voltage, dc current and active power. From a steady state perspective
      it is sufficient to specify the wanted active power transfer (ACDCConverter.targetPpcc)
      and the control functions will set the dc voltage, dc current, firing angle,
      transformer tap position and number of connected filters to meet this. Therefore
      attributes targetAlpha and targetGamma are not applicable in this case.

      The reactive power consumed by the converter is a function of the firing angle,
      transformer tap position and number of connected filter, which can be approximated
      with half of the active power. The losses is a function of the dc voltage and
      dc current.

      The attributes minAlpha and maxAlpha define the range of firing angles for rectifier
      operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place. The range
      is typically 10-18 degrees.

      The attributes minGamma and maxGamma define the range of extinction angles for
      inverter operation between which no discrete tap changer action takes place.
