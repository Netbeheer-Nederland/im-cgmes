      type of closed switches, including  jumpers. Topological nodes change as the
      current network state changes (i.e., switches, breakers, etc. change state).

      For a planning model, switch statuses are not used to form topological nodes.
      Instead they are manually created or deleted in a model builder tool. Topological
      nodes maintained this way are also called "busses".'
